# MISM6202

This repository contains the datasets and sample Jupyter notebooks used in the live sessions. The folder structure is setup as follows:

```
|-- 1_blank
  |-- week_1
  |-- week_2
  :
  v
|-- 2_solution
  |-- week_1
  |-- week_2
  :
  v
|-- data
```

For each week you should follow along in class using the blank notebook from the appropriate week number.  You can also refer to the solution once you've completed the assignment.
